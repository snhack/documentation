# Interested in a Swindon Hackspace?


## What is a Hackspace?

![][Logo]

A [Hackspace][] (or Makerspace) is a place where like-minded people with an interest in technology (electronics, computers, robotics, programming, electronic art etc.) can get together, collaborate, share ideas and resources and make really cool stuff!

The [Swindon Hackspace] formed in June 2012, holding [weekly meetings](http://swindon.hackspace.org.uk/about/#weekly-meetings)
for those interested in making, breaking, and fixing things. We are a new hackspace,
looking to build membership and grow our toolkit.

## What do we do?

![][TestPi]

Members work on a range of projects that usually involve electronic hardware, software
programming, and mechanical assembly. Popular projects often include prototyping
electronic circuits using breadboard, and interfacing with [Arduino], [Raspberry Pi] or
[Stellaris LaunchPad] microcontrollers.

Members occasionally run informal sessions on topics such as [PICAXE], Laser Cutting,
[OpenSCAD], and 3D Printing. If you have an idea for a session you would like to run,
please let us know via the [Google Group][group] or on twitter [@snhack].
